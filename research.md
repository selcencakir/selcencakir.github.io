### Abstract  ###
I develop a model of party formation that explains within-party rent sharing, political selection, and party stability. Parties generate club goods through their control over government functions. Politicians share their political rents with party leaders in exchange for accessing parties’ club goods. I estimate the model for Turkey with a dataset of all listed politicians between 1995 and 2014. I find that the right-wing parties accumulate club goods more easily than they produce rents, which leads to strong party control. Counterfactual exercises provide insights on the institutions that improve the quality of politicians and prevent concentration of power

###  Delegation and Recruitment in Organizations: The Slippery Slope to ``Bad'' Leadership ###

### Abstract  ###
We construct a dynamic model of two-sided matching in labor markets with multi-dimensional agent and firm heterogeneity. We apply it to study optimal party structure and the decision of how (de)centralized candidate recruitment should be. Parties are non-unitary actors and compete at the local markets over recruitment of competent candidates. Local organizers possess an informational advantage over the distribution of politicians’ skill, which is positively related to electoral rent generation. Party leadership has a dual objective: they want simultaneously to maximize a) the organization’s rents and b) their retention probability. Thus, when deciding how centralized recruiting should be, leaders face a trade-off: delegating selection to local party organizations harnesses all available information and increases electoral returns, but also limits a leader’s ability to stack the organization with loyalists who are more likely to retain her should a (stochastic) leadership challenge arrives. Moreover, ideology alters this trade-off in ways that generate welfare non-monotonicities. We characterize an equilibrium delegation rule with two key properties: a) some high-skilled politicians may select into lower performing parties due to ideological alignment, and b) more moderate and competent leaders rely excessively on market-based recruitment and, as a result, survive relatively shorter at the helm of the organization.
