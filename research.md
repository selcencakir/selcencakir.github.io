#### Abstract  ####
I develop a model of party formation that explains within-party rent sharing, political selection, and party stability. Parties generate club goods through their control over government functions. Politicians share their political rents with party leaders in exchange for accessing parties’ club goods. I estimate the model for Turkey with a dataset of all listed politicians between 1995 and 2014. I find that the right-wing parties accumulate club goods more easily than they produce rents, which leads to strong party control. Counterfactual exercises provide insights on the institutions that improve the quality of politicians and prevent concentration of power

###  Delegation and Recruitment in Organizations: The Slippery Slope to "Bad" Leadership ###

#### Abstract ####
Party leaders must choose between decentralizing candidate selection gaining better-informed, electorally competent nominees but eroding
their own grip or centralizing and stocking the slate with loyal but weaker contenders. We model this as a dynamic two-sided matching
game where the leader selects the delegated share. Delegation bridges the leader’s information gap yet heightens her vulnerability to future intra-party challenges, and the loyalty premium rises with ideological extremism. The resulting “slippery-slope” equilibrium predicts that moderate or highly competent leaders delegate more, while extremists centralize and thus endure longer, albeit smaller, parties. Inter-party competition endogenizes delegation complementarities and yields a unique welfare-maximizing quota.

#### Abstract ####
How does political selection respond when the electoral stakes increase? We study the
effect that changes in the intensity of electoral competition has on women’s political repre-
sentation in Turkey. We leverage occurrence of two consecutive legislative elections within
few months as a natural experiment giving rise to a DiD strategy which allows us to identify
JDP’s changes in its list composition and rank as a response to heightened competition. We
find that the latter led to a wholesale removal and demotion of women candidates from its
lists, bucking the previous trend of increasing female representation. Heterogeneity anal-
ysis further reveals that most of the women candidates were removed from electable seats
and safe (conservative) districts. While this is consistent with theories of statistical discrim-
ination, the removal of women even from inconsequential positions also reveals taste-based
discrimination that has a compounding effect. A counterfactual exercise shows that had
lists remained unchanged between the two elections, JDP’s female representation in parlia-
ment would have been up by 50%, thus highlighting the role that intra-party politics play
in exacerbating gender-based discrimination (own-gender bias) in political selection.

#### Abstract  ####
The arrival of Syrian refugees has significantly changed the labor-market conditions and the relative abundance of different skill groups in Turkey. We examine how the arrival of Syrian refugees affects school enrollment and employment of working-age native children using a difference-in-differences instrumental variable methodology. We find a significant drop in employment, largely due to children shifting from work-school balance to education only. School enrollment rises for boys, especially those with educated parents. However, the rate of girls not engaged in employment or education increases, particularly among those with less-educated parents, but decreases for boys with more-educated parents.

### Political Entry Barriers and the Quality of Democracy  ###  
#### (with Emekcan Yücel) ####
#### Abstract  ####
Small parties that have a slim chance of winning a seat exist in most democracies, yet their impact on democratic quality remains understudied. This paper examines the relationship between the nationwide inclusion threshold (NIT), which measures the level of political barriers for small parties, and democratic outcomes. Exploiting within-variation from 86 countries with a proportional representation or a mixed system from 1990 to 2018, we  find that an increase in the NIT is linked to a decrease in the total number of parties competing in an election, a reduction in polarization and hate speech by political parties, and an increase in corruption and public good provision. At the same time, we  find no discernible impact on over 30 indicators of democratic quality. Our findings suggest that while small parties may not cause structural changes in democratic influence the level of political competition and the political climate.

### The Role of Cybersecurity in Economic Performance ###

#### Abstract  ####
Utilizing novel data on over 10,000 disclosed cyber incidents across 190 countries and 21
industries, along with data on governments’ cybersecurity commitments, this paper investigates the impact
of cybersecurity on both industries’ performance and macroeconomic outcomes. Specifically, employing
an instrumental variable (IV) cross-country, cross-industry model with fixed effects, the study demonstrates
that given an exposure level to cyber incidents, industries perform better in countries that have implemented
robust national cybersecurity commitments, such as operational legal frameworks, cooperative measures,
technical advancements, and capacity-building initiatives.
At the macroeconomic level, the paper reveals a statistically significant negative correlation
between the frequency of disclosed cyber incidents and GDP per capita in emerging economies, with more
pronounced effects observed in the public sector, information and telecommunications, finance, and
education industries.This research pioneers the estimation of the link between cybersecurity and economic
performance, addressing the existing uncertainty regarding the returns on cybersecurity investments,
particularly in developing countries. The findings underscore the critical importance of cybersecurity as
firms navigate the digital era.

### A Review of the Economic Costs of Cyber Incidents ###

#### Abstract  ####
Given the rapid digitization of societies and the increase in costly and sophisticated cyber incidents, there is a
rising need to prioritize cybersecurity in the investment agendas of economic actors, especially, governments
and firms. However, a major bottleneck in mainstreaming cybersecurity investments is the unclarity in the
returns and the unidentified link between cyber incidents and economic performance. This literature survey brings together empirical studies on the direct and indirect costs of cyber incidents, highlighting issues in the study of risk-based approaches based on current estimates that could lead to misinformed decisions. First, this survey identifies the vast variety of unfounded estimates of the cost of cyber incidents. Second, the analysis dives into the difficulty of assessing the full spectrum of costs due to the existence of nonnegligible indirect costs. This article argues that to accurately protect cyberspace, policymakers and stakeholders should aim to understand the full spectrum of economic costs of cyber incidents by promoting research through data collection efforts.
