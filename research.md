### Abstract  ###


I develop a model of party formation in which politicians share their political rents with party leaders in exchange for accessing parties' club goods. Bigger parties provide greater club goods but tax politiciansâ€™ rents more upon entry. Therefore, politicians with more assets prefer smaller parties. I estimate my model for Turkey with a dataset of all listed politicians between 1995 and 2014. I find that the right-wing parties accumulate club goods more easily than they produce rents, which leads to ever stronger party control. Counterfactual exercises provide a novel explanation for the differences in party-size distributions across political systems.
