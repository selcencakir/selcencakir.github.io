### Abstract  ###

Although political parties are central to democratic functioning, the internal structure of party organizations is still a black box. I build a model of party formation that explains the within-party power sharing, party stability, and party-size distributions across different electoral systems. In the model, party control over government functions generates club goods. Politicians share their political rents with party leaders in exchange for accessing parties’ club goods. I estimate my model for Turkey with a dataset of all listed politicians between 1995 and 2014. My model matches the high party-switching rate (28.5%) in the Turkish parliament. I find that the right-wing parties accumulate club goods more easily then they produce rents, which leads to strong party control. The counterfactual exercises suggest that the possibility of a coup d'état (granting more bargaining power to politicians) lowers (improves) the average quality of the political class.
