### Abstract  ###

The obscurity of party-membership negotiations may make liberal democracies vulnerable to the concentration of political power. I build a model of party formation that explains power-sharing within parties, party stability, and party-size distributions across different electoral systems. In the model, club goods that are generated by party
control over government functions increase the value of party membership. Politicians share their political rents with party leaders in exchange for accessing partiesâ€™ club goods. I estimate my model for Turkey with a dataset of all listed politicians between 1995 and 2014. My model matches the high party-switching rate (28.5%) that is characteristic of many party-centered systems. I find that the right-wing parties accumulate club goods more easily than they produce rents, which leads to ever stronger party control. The counterfactual exercises provide novel insights on which institutions improve the power-distributions in parties as well as the quality of the political class.
